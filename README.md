# Responsive Navigation bar with HTML CSS and JavaScript

This is just a idea from Kevin Powel on how to build mobile navigation that will work on all screens. It is also accessible for screen readers and mobile first approach. I take the idea and adapt it for my own scenarios, and save it here so I don't need to build it from scratch everytime when I need it. Be aware that this is just an idea and it's not perfect solution.

## Tools used for building this

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to run this file

If you want to run this file locally you can clone it to your computer, install dependencies and run it through your terminal.

It will install only one dependecie which is **live-server**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aalend/responsive-navigation.git

cd responsive-navigation
npm install
npm start
```

Itâ€™s that simple, you can now modify and customize it for your personal use.
